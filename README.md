# Translate

Translate is an app aimed towards helping people translate things in a more simple way. Powered by Google's ML-KIT, users can translate text from images, text, and their own voice.

Using the app is more simple then ever, with translation available after the click of a few buttons. 

# Usage: 

To Begin, select what you would like to translate, whether its text from an image, just text itself, or your own voice. All of these options are available on the home page.

Then, once you select what you would like to translate, select what you would language you are translating from and to. These values will be saved even when the app is closed, 
to allow faster app usage after a while, by speeding up the language selection process. However, all of these values can be changed, and you can switch them whenever you please.

Then follow the page down, take a photo, select a photo, type text, or record your voice. Then once you're done, hit the translate button, and watch the magic happen!

# Functionality
How does this app work? For translation to occur, the app downloads a google language package, which may take a while on the first use of one language to another. After that, translation will happen instantly, 
skipping the process of installing a package, since it has already been installed. Another tool that users can utilize is the download package feature.

Users can install a language package before they translate, this way when they translate, the process will take a shorter amount of time. 


This app will soon be available on Google Play!
